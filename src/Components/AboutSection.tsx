                        Hey, Iâ€™m Aryan Shridhar, a third year undergraduate from Vellore Institute of Technology,
                        pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. I am an open source enthusiast and have a keen
                        interest in developing user-end applications. This curiosity brought me closer to frameworks
                        like React.js, React-Native, Electron.js, Django, Flask and other similar frameworks including a
                        few DL libraries like Pytorch, Keras and so. Apart from my computers, I love playing football
                        and listening to music.
                        <br />
